An attempt at Conway's Game of Life

I tried to recreate Conway's Game of Life simulation in the console. 

You can load in a template for the board from a text file or generate one randomly, inputting its' height and width.

There are a few sample templates in the "patterns" folder.

I've added a 0.5 wait timer before each iteration, to help see the changes in each iteration.
